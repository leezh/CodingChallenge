Ski Zoom Engineer Recruitment Task
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical task. It consists of two parts:

* [A coding challenge](#coding-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

Please submit your code as a pull request containing your changes on this repository, or a forked version of this repository if you would prefer.

## Coding Scenario

In our task scenario, one of our accommodation suppliers has provided us with an API endpoint of all of their hotels, with the star-ratings of the properties and the resorts that they are in.

The sample application is a .NET Core single-page application, with an API backend for accessing data.

The sample code already has a basic page that lists hotels that are retrieved from our supplier's API endpoint. It also contains an example API controller that demonstrates retrieving some simple resort information from an in-memory database.

The coding task is to add some new functionality to the application to satisfy the below [user-stories](#user-stories).

### User Stories

As a **user of the application**  
I can **filter a list of hotels by their star rating**  
So that **I know what quality of hotels are available in the country I want to visit**

As a **user running the application**  
I can **filter a list of hotels that are suitable for families**  
So that **I can advise families about suitable hotels**


### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met.  

- Please complete the above user stories.
- If you have experience with unit testing, it would be great to see examples of this, as it provides more to talk about and helps us see your style of coding.
- Please refactor the code as much as you like to make it modular and testable.

# Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. You may have noticed that the supplier API we use in this sample application can be quite slow. How could you work around this to improve the experience for your users?


# Running Instructions
The sample application uses .NET Core 3.1, which can be downloaded [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).


#### Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
